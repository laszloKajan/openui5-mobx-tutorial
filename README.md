# openui5-mobx-tutorial
Tutorial for SAPUI5/OpenUI5 with reactive MobX model.

Starting from a SAPUI5 app with validation and MessageManager, this tutorial shows you how you can extend an existing app with reactive components step-by-step. 

No need to rewrite everything. New reactive features can be introduced gradually.

Built with unofficial [ui5 bindings](https://github.com/laszloKajan/openui5-mobx-model) for [mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx).

ui5 bindings are a fork of [Christian Theilemann's work](https://github.com/geekflyer/openui5-mobx-model), now seemingly abandoned.

Huge thanks to Christian Theilemann, also for his excellent blog post and insights [Reactive state management in SAPUI5 via MobX](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/01/30/advanced-state-management-in-sapui5-via-mobx/).
